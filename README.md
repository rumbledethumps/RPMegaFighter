Your basic enemy fighter.
Harmless on its own, but
can be overwhelming in
large numbers. Fires a
single shot towards the
enemy. Moves in
diagonal patterns
across the screen towards your
fighter craft.

Your Space Fighter
Your fighter is equipped the
all the tools necessary to
survive wave after wave
of enemies.
Use the **A** button to fire
your automatic primary
weapon. With its high rate of
fire, it is very effective against
fighters at close and far range.

The **X** button fires a spread shot of 3 projectiles.
It is very effective against close-by enemies and
enemies travelling in packs. It has a much slower
rate of fire.

## Levels
As you progress through levels, the difficulty
increases. Enemy ships become faster and more
numerous, requiring superior piloting skills and
strategic shooting. The ultimate challenge awaits
in later levels with powerful alien commanders
that demand precision and quick reflexes

## Game Over
If your spaceship is destroyed or you run out of
lives, the game ends. However, fear not! You can
restart and continue your battle against the ever-
growing hordes of enemies in hopes of achieving
victory.
